# Bookstack packaged by David L Whitehurst
[Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com) is an easy to use web application for keeping technical information.
I use it at home for work and also my company tower Argano Connect hosts it for training and guidelines.

## TL;DR;
```bash
helm repo add dlwhitehurst https://dlwhitehurst.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
helm install bookstack dlwhitehurst/bookstack -n <namespace>
```
